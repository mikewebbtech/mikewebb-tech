  </div><div class="post-content"><p>Mac and their OS&rsquo;s have always been spouted as being a pinnacle of consumer grade IT design and user interface experience.  Pfft, what ever.  I&rsquo;ve been using Mac ever since the Macs OS X came on the scene, not because of the hype and fan fair of a new revolution in home computing but simple because I was was migrating over from a Linux system.</p>
<p>I loved tinkering with my Linux boxes and made a fairly good living as Linux became the cool must have solution for many schools, government organisations and small to medium businesses in my area.  But as I got busier and my focus became more outcome oriented, I wanted something that just worked, was easy to use, was a no brainer and had a huge amount of applications supported that my family was already used to using.</p>
<p>For me the HUGE factor in my decision, was that I was already very comfortable with Linux and BSD systems and once I worked out how to open a terminal, I was off and running on the command line.  Ironic really considering the effort Apple put into their GUI.  On a side note with the GUI, at the time Mac came with X11.  Awesome for remote XDMCP sessions to the various Unix boxes I looked after.</p>
<p>Oh and breaking out a light, shiny, stylish MacBook, jacking into the clients network  and getting down and dirty with remote X sessions, ssh and RDP to the windows servers in an environment dominated with heavy, square and black HP and Toshiba work horse laptops had a kind of wow factor to those that are into that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Moving on there came the iPhones as both my wife and mine HTC smart phones died, an appleTV as my chipped xbox running XBMC died.  My shuttlePC running SUSE had a blowout with the power supply, so that got replaced with an iMAC, which for me, was the nicest looking all-in-one PC going at the time and I was able to slowly able to migrate to full Mac OS usage by dual booting Mac OS X and SUSE.  I bought a Time Capsule to handle Time Machine backups and file server duties to appleTV, iMacs and MacBooks (my son now had a MacBook as well).  Once we got some iPads, our integrating into the Appleverse was complete, for better or worse.</p>
<p>It has not all been smooth sailing but to be honest its&rsquo; been on par with, if not fewer then those I&rsquo;ve provided support to who are running full Microsoft environments (servers, workstations and mobile devices) and the odd few rolling their own with a complete Linux and Android (mobile devices, home theatre, home servers, PC&rsquo;s etc).</p>
<p>I do really like the the DIY open source / Android solution with the flexibility (and cost) that it offers for a bespoke environment but I just don&rsquo;t have time or drive at the moment to install, integrate and manage such a beast, as well as train and support my family or others visiting my home.  But I do still love geeking out reading about it, watching tubes about it and helping other with it.</p>
