      <guid>http://localhost:1313/mikewebb-tech/articles/2025/2025-08-17-risk-mitigation-plans/</guid>
      <description>A risk mitigation plan only works if it&amp;rsquo;s properly executed. This requires change management principles to communicate with everyone, get their buy-in, and continuously monitor that the new processes are being followed. This turns the plan from a static document into a living part of the organisation&amp;rsquo;s culture.</description>

      <description>A Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) is needed to transform an organisation&amp;rsquo;s approach to security incidents from panic to preparedness. It provides a structured playbook  for preparing, detecting, responding to, and recovering from a cybersecurity events.  A CIRP provides clear responsibilities and procedures, minimising harm and accelerating recovery.  Its value is in creating coordinated action in high-pressure situations, preventing disorganisation, and reducing the downtime, costs, and reputational damage that can result from a breach.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/mikewebb-tech/articles/2025/2025-07-28-introduction-to-risk/</guid>
      <description>Risk in cybersecurity is the probability of threats exploiting vulnerabilities to impact assets. Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and controlling threats through structured approach of identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment, and monitoring. This strengthens resilience, improves efficiency, and aligns security contols with organisational strategy while addressing evolving digital threats.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/mikewebb-tech/articles/2025/2025-07-22-cruicial-distinction/</guid>
      <description>In cybersecurity, the terms threats, vulnerabilities, and risks are sometimes used incorrectly and interchangeably, but they are distinct concepts.  Understanding their relationship is fundamental to building an effective security program. Think of them as a logical chain: a threat exploits a vulnerability to create a risk.</description>
